What is Treasury ? 

    Treasury module is a core component that allows for decentralized funding and allocation of 
    resources within the blockchain network. It enable token holder and stake holders to collectively
    manage and distribute funds for various purposes.


who are token holders and stake holders ? 

    Stake holders : 
        stake holders are broader particepants who have an interest in the success and growth of the 
        blockchain echosystem beyond just holding tokens. Stakeholders may include developers,
        validators, miners, users, dapp creators, community organizers, and other individuals or
        entities actively contributing to the network's functionality and value proposition.
        They may also have a voice in governance decisions and funding allocation.
    
    Token Holders:
        Token holders are individuals or entities that hold a certain amount of the native
        cryptocurrency or token of the blockchain network. Their holdings of tokens represent
        a financial stake in the network. Token holders may include investors, traders, users, 
        developers, and anyone who has acquired the blockchain's native tokens. Their influence and
        voting power might be proportional to the number of tokens they hold. Token holders play a 
        role in key decisions through voting mechanisms, such as those related to proposals in the 
        Treasury module.


What is Treasury palette ? 

    Treasury Palette:
        The "Treasury Palette" would likely refer to a specific module implemented within the 
        Substrate framework for managing the treasury functionality. This module would provide the
        necessary logic for creating and managing funding proposals, conducting voting processes, and 
        releasing funds based on the outcomes of those votes. This module would be an essential part
        of the governance and financial ecosystem of a blockchain network like Polkadot.

    Proposal :
        A proposal refers to a formal request submitted by a participant of the network to allocate 
        funds from the treasury to a specific purpose. Any token holder can submit a proposal for 
        funding from the Treasury.

    Voting :
        Voting involves the process by which stakeholders of the network express their support or 
        opposition to these proposed funding requests.

    Discussion and Evaluation:
        Once a proposal is submitted, it goes through a period of discussion and evaluation by the
        community. This can happen through forums, community channels, or dedicated platforms where
        participants can ask questions and share opinions.

    Voting Period:
        After the discussion phase, the proposal enters a voting period. During this time, token
        holders or stakeholders can cast their votes in favor of or against the proposal. The voting period is
        typically time-limited and is defined by the network's governance rules.
